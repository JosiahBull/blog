# Getting started with Scheme by solving an Advent of Code challenge 

Chicken Scheme is a wonderful small and performant implementation of Scheme, a
programming language in the family of LISPs. It's very easy to install and
learn. I learn by doing, so let's solve an Advent of Code challenge with a tiny
Scheme program.

## Installing Chicken Scheme

There should be a package in your favorite package manager. For example on macOS
you would do:

```sh
$ brew install chicken
```

and...that's pretty much it!
