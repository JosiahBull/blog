## About me

I am a Senior Software Engineer from France living in Bavaria, Germany. By day, I work for a Fintech company, and by night I write some fun projects in C, Rust, Odin and Zig. I like to work on low-level systems.

In my free time, I like running, lifting weights, gardening, and the outdoors.
