# Learn Wayland by writing a GUI from scratch

[Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) is all the rage those days. Distributions left and right switch to it, many readers of my previous article on [writing a X11 GUI from scratch in x86_64 assembly](/blog/x11_x64.html) asked for a follow-up article about Wayland, and I now run Waland on my desktop. So here we go, let's write a (very simple) GUI program with Wayland, without any libraries, this time in C. 

Here is what we are working towards:

We display the Wayland logo in its own window (we can see the mountain wallpaper in the background since we use a fixed size buffer). It's not quite Visual Studio yet, I know, but it's a good fundation for more in future articles, perhaps.

Why not in assembly again you ask? Well, the Wayland protocol has some peculiarities that necessitate the use of some C standard library macros to make it work reliably on different platforms (Linux, FreeBSD, etc): namely, sending a file descriptor over a UNIX socket. Maybe it could be done in assembly, but it would be much more tedious. Also, the Wayland protocol is completely asynchronous by nature, whereas the X11 protocol was more of a request-(maybe) response chatter, and as such, we have to keep track of some state in our program, and C makes it easier.

Now, if you want to follow along and translate the C snippets into assembly, go for it, it is doable, just tedious.

## What do we need?

Not much: We'll use C99 so any C compiler of the last 20 years will do. Having a Wayland desktop to test the application will also greatly help.

Note that I have only run it on Linux; it should work (meaning: compile and run) on other platforms running Wayland such as FreeBSD, it's just that I have not tried.

*Note that the code in this article has not been written in the most robust way, it simply exits when things are not how they should be for example. So, not production ready, but still a good learnign resource and a good fundation for more.*

## Wayland basics

Wayland is a protocol specification for GUI applications (and more), in short. We will write the client side, while the server side is a compositor which understands our protocol. If you have a Wayland desktop right now, a Wayland compositor is already running so there is nothing to do.

Much like X11, a client opens a UNIX socket, sends some commands in a specific format (which are different from the X11 ones), to open a window and the server can also send messages to notify the client to resize the window, that there is some keyboard input, etc. It's important to note that contrary to X11, in Wayland, the client only has access to its own window.

It is also interesting to note that Wayland is quite a limited protocol and any GUI will have to use extension protocols.


Most client applications use `libwayland` which is a library composed of C files that are autogenerated from a XML file describing the protocol.
The same goes for extension protocols: they simply are one XML file that is turned into C files, which are then compiled and linked to a GUI application.

Now, we will not do any of this: we will instead write our own serialization and deserialization functions, which is really not a lot of work as you will see.

There are many advantages:
- No need to link to external libraries: no build system complexities, no dynamic linking issues, and so on.
- We do not have to use the callback system that `libwayland` requires.
- We can use the polling mechanism we wish to listen to incoming messages: `poll`, `select`, `epoll`, `io_uring`, `kqueue` on some systems, etc. Here, we will use `poll` for simplicity but the world is your oyster.
- Easy troubleshooting: 100% of the code is our own.
- No XML
- The protocols we will use are stable so the numeric values on the wire should not change underneath us, but in the event they do, we simply have to fix them in our code and compile again.


So at this point you might be thinking: this is going to be so much work! Well, not really. Here are **all** of the Wayland protocol numeric values we will need, including the extension protocols:

```c
static const uint32_t wayland_display_object_id = 1;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_display_event_delete_id = 1;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_registry_event_global = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_shm_pool_event_format = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_buffer_event_release = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_xdg_wm_base_event_ping = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_xdg_toplevel_event_configure = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_xdg_toplevel_event_close = 1;
static const uint16_t wayland_xdg_surface_event_configure = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_display_get_registry_opcode = 1;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_registry_bind_opcode = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_compositor_create_surface_opcode = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_xdg_wm_base_pong_opcode = 3;
static const uint16_t wayland_xdg_surface_ack_configure_opcode = 4;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_shm_create_pool_opcode = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_xdg_wm_base_get_xdg_surface_opcode = 2;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_shm_pool_create_buffer_opcode = 0;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_surface_attach_opcode = 1;
static const uint16_t wayland_xdg_surface_get_toplevel_opcode = 1;
static const uint16_t wayland_wl_surface_commit_opcode = 6;
static const uint32_t wayland_format_argb8888 = 0;
static const uint32_t wayland_header_size = 8;
static const uint32_t color_channels = 4;
```

So, not that much!


## Opening a socket

The first step is opening a UNIX domain socket. Note that this step is exactly the same as for X11, save for the path of the socket. Also, X11 is designed to be used over the network so it does not have to be a UNIX domain socket, on the same machine - but everybody does so on their desktop machine anyway.

To craft the socket path, we follow these simple steps:

- If `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set, attempt to connect to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
- Otherwise, attempt to connect to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-0`
- Otherwise, fail

Here goes:

```c
static int wayland_display_connect() {
  char *xdg_runtime_dir = getenv("XDG_RUNTIME_DIR");
  if (xdg_runtime_dir == NULL)
    return EINVAL;

  uint64_t xdg_runtime_dir_len = strlen(xdg_runtime_dir);

  struct sockaddr_un addr = {.sun_family = AF_UNIX};
  assert(xdg_runtime_dir_len <= cstring_len(addr.sun_path));
  uint64_t socket_path_len = 0;

  memcpy(addr.sun_path, xdg_runtime_dir, xdg_runtime_dir_len);
  socket_path_len += xdg_runtime_dir_len;

  addr.sun_path[socket_path_len++] = '/';

  char *wayland_display = getenv("WAYLAND_DISPLAY");
  if (wayland_display == NULL) {
    char wayland_display_default[] = "wayland-0";
    uint64_t wayland_display_default_len = cstring_len(wayland_display_default);

    memcpy(addr.sun_path + socket_path_len, wayland_display_default,
           wayland_display_default_len);
    socket_path_len += wayland_display_default_len;
  } else {
    uint64_t wayland_display_len = strlen(wayland_display);
    memcpy(addr.sun_path + socket_path_len, wayland_display,
           wayland_display_len);
    socket_path_len += wayland_display_len;
  }

  int fd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (fd == -1)
    exit(errno);

  if (connect(fd, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr)) == -1)
    exit(errno);

  return fd;
}
```
