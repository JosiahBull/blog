# Body of work

I am here recounting chronologically what I have achieved in my career until now. I have a subpar memory so it's great for me to look back on that, and may it also hopefully serve as an interesting insight for recruiters and the like of the kind of work I enjoy and am good at.

## 2013, 8 weeks internship at Cr√©dit Mutuel, Strasbourg, France

This was my first professional experience and happened at one of the big banks in the country. Like most banks that have been founded in the 20th century, they have millions and millions of lines of code in COBOL, and realised this is not tenable and need to migrate to a modern tech stack to be able to keep it simply running. 

I migrated a business application used internally. The original application was a terminal (as in: made for a *hardware* terminal), with a basic UI, talking to a DB2 database, and running on IBM's z/OS on a (real) mainframe in the confines of the bank. The final application was a C# web application, still talking to the same database, but this time running on a Windows server.

In retrospect, that was such a unique experience to work a a 30+ year old codebase running on a tech stack, OS and hardware that most developers will never encounter.

The team insisted (although not unanimously) that I write *new* COBOL code for this brand new applications for the layer that talks to the database. I think they were worried that C# could not do this job properly, for some reason? So I got to do that, in a COBOL IDE made by IBM which only COBOL developers know of. Todo list item ticked, I guess. 

All in all, that was a very interesting social experience and a great insight on how business and developers think and (try to) evolve, and how to attempt to change the tech stack of an existing running application, which is a challenge any company wil face at a moment or another.
